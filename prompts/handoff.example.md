Prepare to hand off this task.  A new programmer is going to be taking over this work.  The new programmer won't have any context other than any specs and plans we've been working with, and the current code.  So, ensure you update the docs with all the context the new programmer will need to pick up where you left off.  If you've learned things that need to go in the spec or plans, then update them accordingly.  Don't create any new handoff docs, just update the spec and/or plan.  Keep in mind our golden rule of thumb for documentation: Don't Repeat Yourself.  Specs are for high level desing and planning docs are for plans, current focus and status.  Keep both detailed but concise.  Avoid fluff and repetition.  Once you are ready to hand off, let me know and await further instructions.

Study the following files in order to understand the project:

1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview, features, and configuration
2. **[DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md)** - Build setup, development workflow, and testing
3. **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** - Documentation index and navigation

After you have studied those files, study the [plans](docs/planning/README.md) and read any other docs in the `docs/planning/` folder.  You should find a [spec doc](docs/planning/SPECIFICATION.md) for the changes we are currently working on.  Study the spec and then audit the code to determine what work needs to be done.  Work with me to develop a new document `/docs/planning/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.  This will hold your plan of action for implementing the spec.
